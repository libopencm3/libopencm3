This example program blinks a LED on PortB Pin 6. 1 second on / 1 second off.
Blinking is done thru the systick timer interrupt.

Building
--------

 $ make

Running 'make' on the top-level libopenstm32 directory will automatically
also build this example. Or you can build the library "manually" and
then run 'make' in this directory.

You may want to override the toolchain (e.g., arm-elf or arm-none-eabi):

 $ PREFIX=arm-none-eabi make

For a more verbose build you can use

 $ make V=1


Flashing
--------

You can flash the generated code using OpenOCD:

 $ make flash

Or you can do the same manually via:

 $ openocd -f interface/jtagkey-tiny.cfg -f target/stm32.cfg
 $ telnet localhost 4444
 > reset halt
 > flash write_image erase systick.hex
 > reset

Replace the "jtagkey-tiny.cfg" with whatever JTAG device you are using, and/or
replace "stm.cfg" with your respective config file.
