The libopenstm32 project aims to create an open-source firmware library for
STM32 microcontrollers.

Status and API
--------------

The libopenstm32 project is currently work in progress. Not all subsystems
of the STM32 are supported, yet.

IMPORTANT: The API of the library is NOT yet considered stable! Please do
           not rely on it, yet! Changes to function names, macro names etc.
           can happen at any time without prior notice!

Building
--------

 $ make

You may want to override the toolchain (e.g., arm-elf or arm-none-eabi):

 $ PREFIX=arm-none-eabi make

For a more verbose build you can use

 $ make V=1


Example projects
----------------

The library ships with a few small example projects which illustrate how
individual subsystems of the SMT32 can be configured and used with
libopenstm32.

For flashing the 'miniblink' example (after you built libopenstm32 and the
examples by typing 'make' at the top-level directory) you can execute:

 $ cd examples/miniblink
 $ make flash

The Makefiles of the examples are configured to use a certain OpenOCD
flash programmer, you might need to change some of the variables in the
Makefile if you use a different one.


Installation
------------

 $ make install

This will install the library in /usr/local. If you want to install it
elsewhere, use the following syntax:

 $ DESTDIR=/opt make install


Coding style
------------

The whole library is programmed using the Linux kernel coding style, see
http://lxr.linux.no/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle for details.

Please use the same style for any code contributions, thanks!
