 *
 * FLASH memory may be used for data storage as well as code, and may be
 * programmatically modified. Note that for firmware upload the GD32F1x0
 * provides a built-in bootloader in system memory that can be entered from a
 * running program.
 *
 * FLASH must first be unlocked before programming. In this module a write to
 * FLASH is a blocking operation until the end-of-operation flag is asserted.
 *
 * @note: don't forget to lock it again when all operations are complete.
