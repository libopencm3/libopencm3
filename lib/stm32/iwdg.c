@brief <b>libopencm3 STM32F1xx Independent Watchdog Timer</b>

@version 1.0.0

@author @htmlonly &copy; @endhtmlonly 2012 Ken Sarkies ksarkies@internode.on.net

@date 18 August 2012

This library supports the Independent Watchdog Timer System in the STM32F1xx
series of ARM Cortex Microcontrollers by ST Microelectronics.

The watchdog timer uses the LSI (low speed internal) clock which is low power
and continues to operate during stop and standby modes. Its frequency is
nominally 32kHz (40kHz for the STM32F1xx series) but can vary from as low
as 17kHz up to 60kHz (refer to datasheet electrical characteristics).

Note that the User Configuration option byte provides a means of automatically
enabling the IWDG timer at power on (with counter value 0xFFF). If the
relevant bit is not set, the IWDG timer must be enabled by software.

@note: Tested: CPU STM32F103RET6, Board ET-ARM Stamp STM32
