"""Generate an nvic.h header from a small YAML file describing the interrupt
numbers.

Code generation is chosen here because the resulting C code needs to be very
repetetive (definition of the IRQ numbers, function prototypes, weak fallback
definition and vector table definition), all being very repetitive. No portable
method to achive the same thing with C preprocessor is known to the author.
(Neither is any non-portable method, for that matter.)"""
