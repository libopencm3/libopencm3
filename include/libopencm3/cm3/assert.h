/** @defgroup debugging Debugging

@brief Macros and functions to aid in debugging

@version 1.0.0

@date 25 September 2012

Two preprocessor defines control the behavior of assertion check macros in
this module. They allow the choice between generated code size and ease of
debugging.

If NDEBUG is defined, all assertion checks are disabled and macros do not
generate any code.

If CM3_ASSERT_VERBOSE is defined, information regarding the position of
assertion checks will be stored in the binary, allowing for more
informative error messages, but also significantly increased code size. As
default assertion checks do not use this information it is only useful if
the application linked with libopencm3 defines its own
cm3_assert_failed_verbose() implementation.
