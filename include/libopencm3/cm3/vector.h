/** @file
 *
 * Definitions for handling vector tables.
 *
 * This implements d0002_efm32_cortex-m3_reference_manual.pdf's figure 2.2
 * (from the EFM32 documentation at
 * http://www.energymicro.com/downloads/datasheets), and was seen analogously
 * in other ARM implementations' libopencm3 files.
 *
 * The structure of the vector table is implemented independently of the system
 * vector table starting at memory position 0x0, as it can be relocated to
 * other memory locations too.
 *
 * The exact size of a vector interrupt table depends on the number of
 * interrupts IRQ_COUNT, which is defined per family.
