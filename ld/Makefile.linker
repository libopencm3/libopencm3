## Linker script generator feature
## -------------------------------
##
## This generator will generate <chipname>.ld linker script file in the project
## directory for the specified device, and this script will be automatically
## used as main linker script during the build process.
##
## WARNING: You must include this file after all shared variables are setup,
## and before the command section begins. Ideal place of the include is exactly
## after the all: rule in Your makefile.
##
## Options
## -------
##
## This feature is configured by specifying variable DEVICE=<device part name>
## in the makefile of Your project.
##
## WARNING Please don't forget to specify full name of the chip you are using.
## Many chip families have device specific letters specified on the end of
## device name string.
##
## Example:
## --------
##
## @code
## DEVICE=stm32f407vgt6
## <... common makefile code ...>
## all: images
##
## include <libopencm3 dir>/ld/Makefile.linker
##
## images: <....>
## @endcode
